# Recursion: Merge Sort 🔀

### About 📖

Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm that divides a list into smaller sublists, sorts them independently, and then merges them back together to obtain a sorted result. It has an average/worst case time complexity of of `O(n logn)`, which makes it much more efficient than other sorting algos like Bubble Sort `O(n^2)`.

### Description 📚

This repo features a Merge Sort algorithm using recursion as well as an `n` length Fibonacci sequence generator using both a recursive and non-recursive approach as a warm-up.

### Challenges 😅

Even though the code is short and sweet, my brain has a hard time grasping each step of the recursive process and would've been really hard to come up with this on my own without external research. 

### Usage 🖊️

```
let array = [4, 8, 6, 2, 1, 7, 5, 3];
console.log(mergeSort(array)); // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
```
